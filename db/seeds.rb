\n\nI was surprised to find such a quiet and beautiful place in Tokyo.
\n\nSince it was April, there were many families taking pictures of first-grade children carrying school bags on their backs, and as I walked along, I thought, ``It's so peaceful.'' ")

It really doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre in the middle of the city anymore.
\n\nIf you come with a stroller I recommend leaving it in the venue hall as, like almost all Japanese gardens, there are lots of large stepping stones and stairs.  Keep an eye on children as there is a pond with fish.  Keep an eye out for the bonsai display at the top of the hill (on display year round) and the teahouse down the bottom (reservations required.)
\n\nIt‚Äôs a fantastic place for an early morning stroll and a cup of tea or coffee. There is a bakery/cafe and if you‚Äôre lucky enough to grab a balcony seat , you can look over the garden while you have a cuppa.")

It was boiling hot outside and we couldn't walk anymore. I needed a nice place for my little one to burn off energy and this was the perfect spot!
\n\nMy little one loved the sand and they had a convient sand blower for when switching between play areas. She also loves the foam slides.
\n\nThe lady working there was also very helpful despite not understanding English, she went above and beyond to assist us even called us a taxi..")
